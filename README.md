Player Performance Prediction & Market Value Analysis Using FIFA21 Data
🚀 Predicting FIFA21 player market values using Machine Learning models (Linear Regression & SVM) on AWS SageMaker & EC2

Overview
This project aims to predict the market value of FIFA21 players based on attributes like overall rating, potential, and skill moves. Using Machine Learning techniques (Linear Regression & Support Vector Machines - SVM), we analyze key player factors that influence valuation and provide insights for football clubs’ scouting & investment decisions.

Project Workflow
🔹 Data Collection & Processing

Processed 18,000+ player records with 100+ attributes (market value, overall rating, wage, etc.).
Cleaned missing data using KNN Imputer (15 nearest neighbors).
Encoded categorical variables with Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding.
🔹 Model Development & Training

Built and trained models using:
Linear Regression (Baseline predictive model).
Support Vector Regression (SVR) (For capturing complex patterns).
Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to optimize C, epsilon, and kernel.
🔹 Deployment & AWS Integration

Amazon SageMaker & EC2 used for scalable model training & inference.
Feature scaling with StandardScaler to normalize input data.
🔹 Evaluation & Results

Metric	Linear Regression	SVM
R² Score	96.95%	96.86%
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)	0.3548	0.3070
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)	0.8300	0.8425
🔹 Insights & Visualization

Identified top 10 most valuable players & clubs based on market value.
Heatmaps & correlation analysis show key player attributes affecting market value.
